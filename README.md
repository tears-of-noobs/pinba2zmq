Pinba to ZeroMQ
=================

Python daemon for collection and basic aggregation of Pinba (http://pinba.org) data.


About
-----
Production ready. It used 24/7 with load around 5000rps on small VPS.
We use data from it too build real-time graphs. (Hope to open-source it to in near future)

How to use
-----

First of all you need to install ProtoBuf from http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/ and fast-python-pb from https://github.com/Greplin/fast-python-pb

After that you need just clone repo:

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/tears-of-noobs/pinba2zmq.git
cd pinba2zmq && git checkout zmq_3_2
python setup.py install
```

Now, if you want pinba2zmq to start with your server (if you have Linux with systemd):

``` shell
systemctl enable pinba2zmq
```

And to start:

``` shell
systemctl start pinba2zmq
```

Command line arguments
-----

When you start pinba2zmq, you can use following arguments:

``` shell
pinba2zmq [-l|--log /path/to/file.log] [-v|--verbose] [-p|--pinba 0.0.0.0:30002] [-o|--out tcp://*:5000]
```

After start it should start listning port 30002 for pinba packets and port 5000 as zeromq.pub socket for results. Results it sends in JSON format.

Format of results:

``` js
[
	['host', 'server', 'script'],
	[rps, doc_size, {'med': 14786, 'max': 14786, 'dev': 14786, 'p85': 14786, 'avg': 14786}], 
	[
		[{'tag_name': 'tag_value', ...}, rps, {'med': 422, 'max': 422, 'dev': 422, 'p85': 422, 'avg': 422}], 
		...
	],
	...
]
```

Time is in folowing format:

``` js
{
	'avg': average
	'med': median, 
	'max': maximum, 
	'dev': stddev, 
	'p85': 85% percentile, 
}
```

All time values is in microseconds.
